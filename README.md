# adas-shell
This project creates a real-time ADAS prototype using Python, OpenCV, and a YOLOv5 AI model. It processes a video feed from a webcam or file to detect lane lines and other vehicles. The system then provides drivers with two critical safety alerts: Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Forward Collision Warning (FCW).
